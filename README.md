# Home Network Security

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to establish a robust and scalable Security Operations Center (SOC) environment within a home network. This setup was designed to simulate the real-world responsibilities of a SOC Analyst, focusing on continuous monitoring, threat detection, and incident response.

The project aimed to provide hands-on experience with industry-standard cybersecurity tools and methodologies, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. By implementing a comprehensive suite of open-source tools, the project sought to replicate the challenges faced by cybersecurity professionals in protecting network infrastructure against evolving cyber threats.

Key goals included:

- Threat Detection and Analysis: Deploying and configuring Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor network traffic and identify potential security threats in real time.

- Log Management and Analysis: Implementing a centralized log management system to collect, store, and analyze logs from various sources, enabling proactive threat identification and forensic investigations.

- Incident Response: Developing and testing incident response procedures to effectively address security incidents, minimize damage, and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.

- Automation and Efficiency: Utilizing scripting tools to automate repetitive tasks, improving the overall efficiency and responsiveness of the SOC environment.

This project was designed as a learning exercise and a proof of concept for building a cost-effective, yet powerful, SOC setup that could be applied in both personal and professional contexts. The experience gained through this project has equipped me with the necessary skills to excel in a SOC Analyst role, where proactive defense and quick response are critical to maintaining the security of digital assets.
