 ### [MYDFIR YouTube: SOC Automation Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR3eamn8ydQ&list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ&index=6)

## Objective
This guided project aimed to set up a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment to monitor and protect a home network. The project focuses on the detection and analysis of potential security threats using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## Project Overview
This project involved configuring a variety of open-source security tools to create a comprehensive monitoring solution. The setup was designed to simulate a real-world SOC environment, enabling proactive threat detection, log analysis, and incident response.

### Skills Learned

- Network Security: Gained hands-on experience in monitoring and securing a home network environment.
  
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Set up and configured IDS tools to detect and analyze potential security threats.
  
- Log Analysis: Learned how to collect, forward, and analyze logs using Filebeat, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.
  
- Threat Hunting: Conducted threat hunting exercises to identify and mitigate potential risks proactively.
  
- Incident Response: Simulated and responded to various security incidents, improving readiness for real-world scenarios.
  
- Scripting: Used PowerShell for automation, improving efficiency in the SOC environment.

### Tools Used
- Wazuh: For host-based intrusion detection and log management.
- Filebeat: To collect and forward logs to Elasticsearch.
- Elasticsearch: For storing and indexing logs for analysis.
- Kibana: To visualize logs and create custom dashboards for real-time monitoring.
- Wireshark: For network traffic analysis and packet inspection.
- Suricata: For network intrusion detection and monitoring.
- PowerShell: For scripting and automating various tasks.

### Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the practical aspects of network security, from setting up and configuring monitoring tools to actively defending against potential threats. It serves as a foundational experience for a future role as a SOC Analyst, equipping me with the skills needed to protect digital environments.
